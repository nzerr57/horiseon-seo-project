# Horiseon SEO Project

## Description

The objective of this project was to take existing code and improve its search engine optimization, accessibility, and overall readability. This was achieved by altering the HTML and CSS of the webpage. 

Some of the steps taken to improve the webpage include:

- A title was added to describe the webpage
- Consolidating CSS class when possible (many were redundant)
- Changing HTML elements to better fitting semantic ones
- Alt text was added to images for accessibility
- Comments were added to the CSS and HTML files
