# Horiseon SEO Project

## Description

The objective of this project was to take existing code and improve its search engine optimization, accessibility, and overall readability. This was achieved by altering the HTML and CSS of the webpage. 

Some of the steps taken to improve the webpage include:

- Adding a title to describe the webpage
- Consolidating CSS class when possible (many were redundant)
- Changing HTML elements to better-fitting semantic ones
- Resizing images to increase load times
- Adding Alt text to images for accessibility
- Adding comments to the CSS and HTML files
